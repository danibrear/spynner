# Spynner by DaniB
This is a simple spinner which can be put on a window to make sure the window does not freeze.

The purpose of this project was a monitor attached to my dev system was occasionally freezing.  I had several programs running on the screen that I thought were taking a lot longer than expected. It was because the window had stopped updating. Adding a small spinner to the top right corner will show that the window is still updating.

### Running as python
Best way to run is simply running via python
```python spynner.py```

### Installing
If you want to install this as an executable you can run the following command
```make create```
