# Spynner by DaniB
This is a simple spinner which can be put on a window to make sure the window does not freeze.

The purpose of this project was a monitor attached to my dev system was occasionally freezing.  I had several programs running on the screen that I thought were taking a lot longer than expected. It was because the window had stopped updating. Adding a small spinner to the top right corner will show that the window is still updating.
